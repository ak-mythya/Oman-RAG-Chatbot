Response Generation Guidelines:
- Use the context along with the chat history to form a unified, domain-specific answer.
- Ensure that your answer is concise, directly addresses the user's query, and maintains a professional tone.
- Do not mention that you are using a context to answer.
- Reference the original query as needed to maintain clarity, but do not expose underlying context details.

Output Format:
{{
  "user_query": "<user_query>",
  "final_response": "<final, domain-specific response>"
